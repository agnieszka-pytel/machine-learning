# CNN chest x-ray classification

This folder contains files for academic project written during ML course at AGH University of Science and Technology.

File "Pytel_Agnieszka_projekt.pdf" contains project description in Polish.

File "cnn-chest-x-ray-classification.py" contains executable code of the project.

File "cnn-chest-x-ray-classification.ipynb" is a Jupyter notebook with executed code and description in English.

File "cnn-chest-x-ray-classification.html" has the same content as Jupyter notebook, but can be easily opened in any web browser.

NOTE: This project uses GPU instead of just CPU, so it is necessary to have preferably NVIDIA processor that is dedicated for deep learning, otherwise the code execution will last much longer.
The code was written in a Jupyter notebook on Kaggle platform and the results are obtained using cumputational resources (GPU) provided by the platform.
